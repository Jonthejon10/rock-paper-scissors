# rock-paper-scissors
By completing this project I learned a bit about loops, how to develop different scenarios based on input and how to use the random method, amongst other things.
I really struggled with loops and trying to make it so it has 5 rounds and displays win/loss messages, but in the end it was really satisfactory and I enjoyed the journey.
